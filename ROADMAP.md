# Globus roadmap

## v0.1 — repo skeleton + module library

Shipped:

- ✅ 26 server modules extracted from the buildwithsumit reference
  implementation (chrome, page builders, LLM dispatcher, DB layer,
  agents subsystem, voice helpers).
- ✅ Full MySQL schema (`schema/globus_schema.sql`) — 35 tables, all
  per-member-isolated.
- ✅ Config templates (`.env.example`, `persona.example.md`).
- ✅ Generic example agents catalog (`globus_agents_catalog.py` ships
  Research / Sales Desk / Narada / Infra Watch — replace with yours).
- ✅ Install docs (`INSTALL.md`) covering MySQL, .env, LLM provider
  choice, systemd unit.
- ✅ Architecture docs (`ARCHITECTURE.md`) — module map, data flow,
  refactor history.

## v0.2 — fully working text chat

Shipped:

- ✅ **Chat orchestrator** — `globus_orchestrator.py` ports
  `_globus_run_tools_loop` + `globus_chat_send` (~430 lines): the
  tool-use loop, persona loading with priority chain
  (`config/persona.md` → `persona.example.md` → default), injection
  detection, daily-cap accounting, forced-synth fallback, empty-search
  backstop, markup-leak recovery.
- ✅ **Member auth flow** — `globus_auth.py` ships email-OTP via
  SendGrid (with stderr fallback for dev), 6-digit codes hashed with
  HMAC-SHA256, 5/hour rate limit, 10-minute expiry, plus cookie
  parsing for the `bws_member` session.
- ✅ **Vault upload endpoint** — `POST /members/globus/upload` handles
  Obsidian zips (base64) + paste, wired to `globus_extract_md_from_zip`
  + `globus_upsert_source`.
- ✅ **Routes** — `globus_server.py` rewritten as a real entrypoint:
  `/`, `/globus`, `/api/health`, `/members/login` (GET+POST),
  `/members/login/code` (GET+POST), `/members/logout`, `/members`,
  `/members/globus`, `/members/globus/setup`,
  `/members/globus/upload` (POST), `/members/globus/chat` (POST),
  `/members/vault-progress`, `/api/globus/vault-progress`,
  `/api/globus/agent-status` (stub), `/api/globus/client-error`.
- ✅ **Disk-cache `read_file`** — v0.2 reads `extracted_path` files
  directly; Drive/Gmail downloads are deferred to v0.3.
- ✅ **`mark_chat_resolved` tool** — silences stale alerts;
  no-op-safe (returns clear error if `sanjay_alerts` table is absent).
- ✅ **Explicit `_V03_TOOLS` set** — `list_recent_emails`,
  `send_telegram_via_bot`, `run_agent` return a clear "not registered
  in v0.2" error if the LLM calls them.

After v0.2, a fresh installer can: sign up via OTP, upload an Obsidian
zip, and have a working text-chat conversation with Globus over their
own data — no voice, no Drive/Gmail, no WA/TG yet.

What's intentionally NOT in v0.2:
- Google OAuth login (Drive/Gmail sync is v0.3 — login stays OTP-only)
- Voice (ElevenLabs custom-LLM endpoint is v0.4)
- Agents subsystem (v0.5)

## v0.3a — Google Drive vault

Shipped:

- ✅ **Google OAuth core** (`server/google_oauth.py`) — state CSRF,
  authorize URL builder, code exchange, refresh token, userinfo, revoke.
  Wired to the `cfg()` config table so credentials live in MySQL, not env.
- ✅ **OAuth connection storage** (`server/oauth_db.py`) — Fernet-encrypted
  refresh + access tokens at rest (`GLOBUS_OAUTH_ENCRYPTION_KEY` config),
  per-member CRUD, `get_valid_access_token()` with auto-refresh +
  needs_reconnect flagging on `invalid_grant`.
- ✅ **Drive API + extractors** (`server/google_drive.py`) — paginated
  list/export/download, mime classification (Docs→md, Sheets→XLSX,
  Slides→txt, plain text passthrough), full XLSX flattener that
  preserves every tab (Drive's CSV export drops everything past sheet 1),
  per-member-isolated disk cache at `RAW_DATA_DIR/{email}/{account}/...`.
- ✅ **Sync orchestrator + bg worker** (`server/sync_drive.py`) —
  5-pass sync (discover, classify, parallel-download 24-worker pool,
  index, aggregate), connection dispatcher, daemon background loop
  with stale-`running` reclaim on service start (per Sumit's prod
  gotcha — a mid-sync restart froze the CRM connector for 5 days
  before we noticed it).
- ✅ **Routes** wired into `globus_server.py`: GET `/members/connect`,
  GET `/members/connect/google/start?drive=1`, GET
  `/members/connect/google/callback`, POST
  `/members/connect/google/sync`, POST
  `/members/connect/google/disconnect`.
- ✅ **On-demand `read_file`** — when an indexed Drive file has no
  cached extract yet, the orchestrator downloads + extracts + caches
  on the fly so chat never has to wait for the full sync to complete.
- ✅ **Schema additions** — `globus_oauth_states.state_token` +
  `expires_at` + `redirect_after`, `globus_oauth_connections.user_info` +
  `drive_folder_ids` + `gmail_query`, `globus_vault_files.skip_reason` +
  `updated_at` + UNIQUE KEY on (email, source_type, external_id),
  new `globus_sync_runs` history table.

## v0.3b — Gmail vault

Shipped:

- ✅ **Gmail API + body extractor** (`server/google_gmail.py`) — paginated
  message list (50K message ceiling), per-message GET (`format=full`),
  recursive text/plain → text/html-with-tag-strip fallback body extractor,
  RFC-2822 → naive UTC date parser so `modified_at` is a real TIMESTAMP
  PyMySQL can write.
- ✅ **Gmail sync workers** (`server/sync_gmail.py`):
  - `sync_gmail_connection(conn)` — full crawl, default query
    `newer_than:90d -in:spam -in:trash`, 24-worker parallel pool, per-
    message disk cache + globus_vault_files index + top-100-recent
    aggregated row.
  - `sync_gmail_delta(conn, query, max_wall_sec)` — incremental: lists
    IDs in window, dedups against vault, fetches only NEW ones with
    20-second wall-clock cap.
  - `globus_freshen_gmail(email, background=...)` — per-member
    cooldown-throttled (1/min) delta sync hook used inline by
    list_recent_emails; voice path passes `background=True` to avoid
    blowing ElevenLabs' per-turn budget.
- ✅ **Dispatcher** — `sync_drive.sync_connection` now fans out to
  `sync_gmail_connection` for the `gmail` source. Sources sorted
  fast-first (Gmail before Drive).
- ✅ **`list_recent_emails` tool** registered in the orchestrator when
  `sync_gmail` imports cleanly; `_V03_TOOLS` now only holds
  `send_telegram_via_bot` + `run_agent`. Calls `globus_freshen_gmail`
  inline so chat answers from fresh inbox state.
- ✅ **Connect-flow checkbox** — `/members/connect/google/start` accepts
  `?gmail=1` (alone or combined with `?drive=1`); error message says
  "Pick at least one source (Drive or Gmail)".
- ✅ **Bug fix in `_globus_capabilities_block`** — was crashing chat with
  `TypeError: sequence item 0: expected str instance, NoneType found`
  when a vault row had `provider_account=NULL`. Now skips those rows.

## v0.3c (partial) — Telegram / WhatsApp / Teams bridges

Shipped:

- ✅ **WhatsApp + Teams Chrome-extension ingest** (`server/bridge_ingest.py`):
  one 90-day HMAC token covers both endpoints. POST
  `/api/globus/whatsapp/ingest` and POST `/api/globus/teams/ingest`
  accept JSON batches of up to 500 messages (4 MB max), bulk-insert
  into `globus_whatsapp_messages` / `globus_teams_messages` with
  fingerprint-based dedup (resending the same message is a no-op).
  GET `/members/whatsapp` renders the existing setup page with a
  freshly-minted token on every load.
- ✅ **Schema deltas** — `fingerprint VARCHAR(64)` + `UNIQUE KEY
  uniq_email_fp` on both message tables. Teams gets `ms_message_id`,
  `chat_type`, `sender_user_id`, `body_type`, `ms_ts` columns the
  extension already populates.
- ✅ **Members landing tile** — new "Teams & WhatsApp" tile points
  at `/members/whatsapp`.

Outstanding:

- [ ] **Chrome extension itself** — lives in the separate
  [Build-With-Sumit/whatsapp-bridge](https://github.com/Build-With-Sumit/whatsapp-bridge)
  repo (per the existing connectors_html setup page). One extension,
  two scrapers (WA Web + teams.live.com). Sumit's reference
  implementation is the upstream — fork + customise UI as needed.
- [ ] **Telegram (Telethon daemon)** — the public bridge repository is not yet
  published. The Globus server's read path (`search_telegram` tool) is already
  shipped; a deployment still needs a daemon writing into
  `globus_telegram_messages`.
- [ ] **Microsoft Teams via Graph API** (server-side OAuth + cron sync) —
  alternative to the Chrome-extension Teams ingest. Mirrors the
  Drive/Gmail OAuth shape. ~400 lines if you want it; the extension
  path is the lighter-weight option.

## v0.4 — voice

Shipped:

- ✅ **ElevenLabs custom-LLM endpoint** — POST
  `/api/globus/voice-llm/chat/completions`. Accepts OpenAI-shape chat
  completions requests from EL's cloud, verifies the voice token,
  drops ASR-noise inputs (Whisper hallucinations like "thanks for
  watching"), runs through the chat orchestrator (same brain as text
  chat), returns either JSON or SSE stream. ~150 lines in
  `server/voice_route.py`.
- ✅ **Voice token route** — GET `/api/globus/voice-token` (cookie-
  authed) issues a fresh 6h HMAC token for long-session refresh.
  The chat page also embeds a token at render time so most loads
  never need to call this.
- ✅ **Setup doc** — `docs/voice-setup.md` walks through ElevenLabs
  agent creation, custom LLM wiring, allowlist + voice token security,
  and what's intentionally NOT in OSS v0.4 (per-turn keepalive,
  DeepSeek fallback chain, word-by-word streaming).

What's intentionally NOT in v0.4 OSS:
- Per-turn keepalive thread (prod emits filler audio during long tool
  calls so EL doesn't time out). The OSS path relies on tool calls
  finishing in under EL's per-turn budget (~25s). Keep `read_file`
  paths fast.
- True progressive SSE token streaming. OSS sends the full reply as
  one chunk + a finish chunk; EL starts TTS as soon as it arrives.
  Replace `voice_llm_sse_chunks()` if you need word-by-word.
- DeepSeek-V3 fallback chain. The chat orchestrator already handles
  provider switching via `GLOBUS_LLM_PROVIDER` — no separate voice
  routing needed.

## v0.5 — agents

Shipped:

- ✅ **OSS-native agent runner** (`server/agent_runner.py`, ~250 lines)
  — no Hermes dependency. An agent is a catalog entry with a
  `task_prompt`; running it = call the chat orchestrator with that
  prompt as the member's question, write the LLM reply to disk as
  a dated markdown brief, track the run in `globus_agent_runs`.
- ✅ **`globus_agent_runs` history table** — one row per run (success
  + failure + still-running). Drives the chat-page activity console
  + the /members/globus/agents dashboard.
- ✅ **Sample agents** — `research`, `sales-desk`, `infra-watch`
  now ship with actual `task_prompt` fields. Adapt as you like;
  these run unmodified on any v0.5 install.
- ✅ **`run_agent` LLM tool** registered when `agent_runner` imports
  cleanly. Fires the agent fire-and-forget; brief lands ~30s later
  in the activity console. Member can also click "Run now" on the
  /members/globus/agents dashboard.
- ✅ **`/members/globus/agents` dashboard** (`agents_dashboard_html.py`)
  — running-now panel + recent-runs table + catalog cards with
  per-agent "last brief" badges.
- ✅ **`/api/globus/agent-status` endpoint** — JSON, polled by the
  chat-page console every 5s. Per-member scoped.
- ✅ **`scripts/run_agent.py`** — cron-friendly CLI:
  `python3 scripts/run_agent.py <agent> <member-email>`. Exits 0 on
  success / 1 on catalog-or-member error / 2 on run failure.
- ✅ **Per-member work dir** — briefs land at
  `$GLOBUS_AGENTS_WORK_DIR/<sha1(email)[:16]>/<agent>-<YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM>.md`
  (default `/var/lib/globus/agents/...`). One member can never read
  another member's briefs (FS-level isolation via path).

Reference Hermes adapter — `server/agents_runtime.py` is still shipped
for installs that already use the Hermes runner (multi-tenant agent
fleet with `/opt/hermes/bin/run-agent.sh`). The OSS-native runner is
the default; wire the Hermes adapter into the route handler if you
prefer that execution model.

## v0.6 — Narada, the Outbound Agent

Globus's first marketer-facing product feature. End-to-end cold-
outreach platform with a plugin architecture — any tool in the 12
categories from the PRD plugs in by implementing one of 5 protocols.
See [`docs/prd/narada-outbound-agent.md`](docs/prd/narada-outbound-agent.md).

### Phase 0 shipped — plugin spine

- ✅ `server/narada_plugins/` package — protocols (LeadSource /
  Verifier / Sender / CRM / LinkedInChannel), types (dataclasses for
  Lead, ICPFilters, VerifyResult, SendResult, Reply, …), registry
  with auto-loader that walks the package and self-registers every
  plugin.
- ✅ `server/narada_core.py` — campaign + prospect + send state
  machine. Suppression check on every queue_send (default-deny).
  Per-member ownership via WHERE clauses on every read.
- ✅ `server/narada_creds.py` — per-member, per-tool Fernet-encrypted
  credential vault. Reuses `GLOBUS_OAUTH_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (one key
  per install).
- ✅ `server/narada_copy.py` — LLM-driven 3-variant copy gen with
  safety-rule system prompt + winning-angle memory + JSON-output
  parsing + fallback variant on LLM fail.
- ✅ Schema — 6 new tables: `globus_narada_campaigns / _prospects /
  _sends / _suppression / _credentials / _angle_memory`.

### Phase 1 shipped — first-wave plugins + UI + LLM tools

- ✅ **Gmail sender** (`narada_plugins/gmail_composio.py`) — sends
  via member's own Gmail/Workspace through Composio's managed OAuth.
  Native reply detection via the same connection. ~1500/day cap.
- ✅ **Prospeo** (`narada_plugins/prospeo.py`) — LeadSource AND
  Verifier from the same subscription. People search + email find +
  verify, all 1-credit-per-call.
- ✅ **Freshsales CRM** (`narada_plugins/freshsales.py`) — upserts
  contacts + creates deals + logs activities. Per-member subdomain +
  API key.
- ✅ **Dashboard** (`server/narada_html.py`) at `/members/narada`:
  campaign list, credentials manager, campaign builder, campaign
  detail with state-machine action buttons (find leads / verify /
  draft / send / check replies).
- ✅ **8 LLM tools** wired into the chat orchestrator:
  `narada_create_campaign`, `narada_find_leads`, `narada_draft_copy`,
  `narada_send_campaign`, `narada_check_replies`,
  `narada_campaign_stats`, `narada_list_campaigns`,
  `narada_list_plugins`. `_V03_TOOLS` not-registered set is back to
  empty.
- ✅ **Agent catalog entry** — Narada appears at
  `/members/globus/agents` as a card; "Run now" produces a brief of
  current campaign state + suggested next moves.
- ✅ **Members landing tile** — direct link from `/members`.

### Phase 2+ — queued (each plugin ships as you provide API keys)

Remaining plugins from the PRD's top-10 lists, ordered by likely
unlock first:

- Smartlead, Lemlist, EmailBison, Instantly, Apollo Sequences,
  Reply.io, Mailshake, custom SMTP — sender expansion
- Apollo, Hunter, Clay, ZoomInfo, RocketReach, FindyMail —
  lead source + enrichment expansion
- NeverBounce, ZeroBounce, MillionVerifier, BriteVerify — verifier
  expansion
- HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive, Close, Attio (mostly via Composio
  — fast to land)
- Heyreach, Dripify, Expandi, Lemlist (LinkedIn), Phantombuster —
  LinkedIn outbound (TOS-disclaimer-gated)
- Smartlead/Lemwarm/Warmup-Inbox warmup plugins
- WhatsApp (Twilio/Wati/AiSensy/Meta Cloud API)
- Phone/voice (AirCall/Dialpad/Orum/JustCall)

Each is ~1-2 hours of plugin work once credentials are in. No
architecture changes after Phase 0 + 1.

## v0.7 (in progress) — Globus for Organizations

Optional multi-tenant **employee portals**: one company gets its own host
(e.g. `globus.acme.com`) where employees self-enroll with their company
email, and each chats with Globus grounded strictly on their OWN connected
data. Entirely opt-in — with no `organizations` rows the server behaves
exactly as the single-tenant install it is today.

Landed:

- ✅ **Isolation data layer** — `server/org_db.py`. Authorization on an org
  host is `(arrival Host → org_id) INTERSECT (email is an active
  org_member)`; it never consults the single-tenant member check. Every
  predicate **fails closed** (a DB error denies), a suspended org denies
  rather than falling through to the single-tenant site, domain matching is
  exact (no `acme.com.evil.com` confusion), and `auto_enroll` writes only
  `org_members` so an employee never becomes a single-tenant member.
- ✅ **Schema** — `organizations`, `org_domains`, `org_members`,
  `org_agent_grants`, shipped data-free.
- ✅ **Default-private agent sharing** — an employee sees an agent only once
  an admin grants it to everyone, their department, or them personally.
- ✅ **Tests** — `tests/test_org_db.py` covers the isolation properties
  above (31 checks, hermetic: no DB or network).
- ✅ **Config knobs** — `ORG_PORTAL_HOSTS` (fail-closed host→slug fallback),
  optional separate `ORG_GOOGLE_OAUTH_*` client, `ORG_GOOGLE_LOGIN_ENABLED`,
  legal-page identity.

- ✅ **The portal itself** — host gate + routes + UI. Email one-time-code
  sign-in (domain-gated, and it answers identically for an unregistered
  domain so it can't be used to enumerate tenants or addresses), optional
  "Continue with Google", employee chat, self-connect (Drive/Gmail), the
  admin console (sharing grants + team/roles), and pre-auth legal pages
  whose operator identity comes from config, defaulting to the org's name.
- ✅ **Allow-list routing** — on an org host only the org plane answers;
  anything not explicitly allow-listed 404s, so an org host can never serve
  the operator's own single-tenant surfaces. A small set of already
  per-email-scoped routes (chat API, Google connect callback/sync) is shared
  rather than duplicated, and only after the employee is confirmed active.
- ✅ **Tests** — `tests/test_org_gate.py`, 40 checks against the real handler
  with stubbed I/O: deny-by-default, no-fall-through, non-admin 404s, no
  tenant enumeration, and that the gate is a **no-op on a plain
  single-tenant install** (including when the org tables don't exist).
- 📄 See INSTALL.md → "Enable an org portal".

- ✅ **Shared agents for orgs — the grant model now has a consumer.** The
  reconciliation turned out to be simpler than feared: agent runs are already
  keyed by `member_email`, so employees are isolated for free, and the
  dashboard renders from a catalog + status. So the org surface is the normal
  one with the catalog **filtered by the employee's grant set**.
  - **The run route re-authorizes.** Filtering the dashboard is presentation,
    not access control — the single-tenant run handler knows nothing about
    grants, so falling through to it would let any employee run any agent in
    the catalog by posting its slug. `/members/globus/agents/run` checks the
    grant set itself and 404s otherwise.
  - **Admins see the whole catalog** without granting it to themselves,
    otherwise the first admin of a new org faces an empty page and no way to
    fill it.
  - **No grants yet gets an explanation, not an empty page** — an empty
    dashboard reads as "this is broken"; the page says the workspace is
    private by default and who can change that. The home page hides the
    Agents link entirely until something is shared.

## v0.8 — Email intelligence

Two cron'd passes over a connected Gmail mailbox, plus a daily roll-up.
An inbox produces far more mail than anyone can read, but only a little of
it needs a decision — so a cheap pass files what it recognises, and an
expensive pass reads only what's left.

- ✅ **Tier 1 — triage** (`email_intel.triage_mailbox`): a cheap model files
  mail into an operator-defined taxonomy from `From`/`Subject`/snippet only,
  in batches. Optional deterministic sender→label rules run first, because a
  lookup table is cheaper, always right, and — the real reason — *consistent*:
  a model spells the same vendor three ways across runs and the taxonomy
  quietly fragments.
- ✅ **Tier 2 — reason** (`email_intel.reason_mailbox`): a stronger model reads
  the full body of only the mail Tier 1 left unfiled, judges it against the
  operator's business context, and records `{category, urgency, action}` plus
  one "needs action" label. Urgency is defined by *response time*, not tone —
  marketing urgency is not urgency.
- ✅ **The layer rule.** Tier 2 finds unfiled mail by asking whether a message
  carries **any** Gmail user label (`Label_*` ids) — it couples to the
  *existence of a decision*, never to Tier 1's taxonomy. Buckets can be added
  or renamed freely, and a human filing something by hand removes it from
  Tier 2's scope for free.
- ✅ **Non-destructive by construction.** The only Gmail write available is
  add-label; there is no archive/move/delete helper for these agents to reach
  for. Nothing here ever sends email.
- ✅ **Heartbeat-gated digest.** Every run stamps a per-mailbox beacon —
  *including* the runs that find nothing — and the digest refuses to report
  all-clear for any mailbox whose beacon is stale or absent, naming the dead
  one and how long it's been. Without this, an empty table and a dead pipeline
  are indistinguishable, and the digest sends a confident daily all-clear over
  a pipeline that stopped weeks ago.
- ✅ **Cost bounded under upstream failure.** The listing cap and the
  model-call cap are separate knobs — *cap the spend, never the sight* — so a
  small budget can't silently shorten the lookback window. Overflow is
  announced and deferred, never dropped.
- ✅ **Tests** — `tests/test_email_intel.py`, 41 hermetic checks (no DB, no
  network, no LLM) over the heartbeat gate, parse-failure handling, digest
  chunking, and env-flag parsing.
- 📄 See INSTALL.md → "Enable email intelligence".

Next:

- A pluggable notifier interface (today: Telegram, else stdout).
- Optional archiving as a separate, explicitly opted-in capability — never a
  side effect of a taxonomy bucket.

## v0.9 — Sales desk

A daily ranked call list, a short priorities brief, and a pipeline hygiene
report — pushed into chat rather than a dashboard nobody opens. **Read-only:
it never writes to a CRM and never sends email.**

The shape: `gather → bound → dedup → rank (batched LLM, global indices) →
band-merge → fail open to a deterministic sort → chunk → deliver → beacon`.
Deterministic code does only what is *not* judgment — eligibility, dedup,
bounding, arithmetic. The model decides what matters now and what the next
step is, because a status-lookup sort can't tell you that a lead who replied
"send me pricing" three days ago outranks a fresher one who never answered.

- ✅ **Batched ranking with global indices.** Ranking is batched because the
  reliability ceiling is on OUTPUT rows: ask for one line per lead and the
  model drops rows long before the input runs out — and a truncated ranking
  looks exactly like a complete one. Indices are global so batches merge, and
  the four priority bands are ABSOLUTE (never "rank these relative to each
  other") so independently-ranked batches stay comparable.
- ✅ **Nothing is silently dropped.** A lead the model skipped is appended with
  a derived band and flagged, never omitted. A hallucinated index outside the
  batch is rejected; an unknown band is coerced rather than dropping the lead.
- ✅ **A partial ranking is discarded, not shipped.** Below an 85% parse floor
  the whole ranking is thrown away and the deterministic order is used — a
  short list reads as a complete one to whoever gets it.
- ✅ **Fails open everywhere.** Ranking down → deterministic order. Brief down →
  list posts without it. A broken lead source → the others still run. A sales
  team that doesn't get its list has no fallback; they just don't call anyone.
- ✅ **Fails closed on an empty feed.** An empty call list is indistinguishable
  from a quiet day, so it raises loudly and alerts the operator instead.
- ✅ **Never posts an error as content.** A model failure returns empty, and an
  implausibly short brief is treated as a failure — a fluent refusal is
  well-formed and would otherwise sail into the team channel as the brief.
- ✅ **Stage names are data.** `{status: {callable, weight, terminal}}` in
  config; no status string appears in logic, and an unknown stage stays
  callable. Timezone is config too — never an inline offset.
- ✅ **Beacon on every completion** + failure DM to an ops target, so "the desk
  stopped" is queryable and the team channel never sees a stack trace.
- ✅ **Tests** — `tests/test_sales_desk.py`, 36 hermetic checks.
- 📄 See INSTALL.md → "Enable the sales desk".

Known limit — **reading a CRM is an open extension point.** The bundled CRM
plugins implement a WRITE protocol (upsert/create/log) and deliberately do not
read, so the built-in source reads this install's own outbound pipeline
instead. Adding a per-vendor read (pagination, field hydration, rate limits) is
real work and is left as a documented seam rather than faked.

## v0.10 — Opportunity tracker

Any pursuit you send into the world and then lose track of: job applications,
partnership pitches, grant or CFP submissions, sponsorship asks. You send
dozens, replies trickle back over weeks from addresses that look nothing like
where you sent them, and "where does this stand?" quietly becomes "no idea".

Records each outbound opportunity, reads **your** mailbox to match replies
back to the right one, classifies what kind of reply it is, and reports the
funnel plus what's gone quiet. **Read-only on mail; it never sends anything.**

- ✅ **The distinction that carries the whole thing:** an automated screener or
  assessment is a *response*, but it is **not** a human conversation. It's
  checked FIRST, because the wording deliberately overlaps ("complete a short
  assessment", "your video interview") and folding them together inflates the
  one number you actually care about.
- ✅ **Marketing is excluded outright.** Job alerts, newsletters and "we're
  hiring!" blasts match a sender domain perfectly and would otherwise register
  as replies from that company.
- ✅ **Stages only move FORWARD.** Replies arrive out of order; a templated
  acknowledgement landing after an interview invitation must not rewind the
  funnel. Re-running over the same mail is a no-op.
- ✅ **Conservative matching.** Sender domain is authoritative; name matching
  requires two distinctive tokens (one only if that's all the org has), and
  all-generic names like "The Solutions Company" never match. A wrong match
  silently rewrites an unrelated opportunity's history — a miss just reads as
  "no response yet", which is at least honest.
- ✅ **Model fallback is OFF by default** — the patterns handle the vast
  majority, and a tracker that silently costs money per inbound message is a
  bad default. When on, an unparseable answer leaves the message unclassified
  rather than guessing it into the funnel.
- ✅ **Stale list, not auto-chasing.** Chasing is a judgment call, so it hands
  you the candidates and stops. If you want outbound, Narada already does it
  properly with suppression and per-send caps.
- ✅ **Tests** — `tests/test_opportunity_tracker.py`, 46 hermetic checks.
- 📄 See INSTALL.md → "Enable the opportunity tracker".

**Deliberately not included.** The private system this is derived from also
automates *acquiring* and *submitting* opportunities — logged-in scraping of a
job board via a throwaway account, and driving third-party application forms
end to end (including fetching emailed verification codes). Those are omitted
on purpose: they violate the platforms' terms, the scraping half relies on a
burner account precisely because it gets banned, and mass-submitting forms
without a human reading them is not a thing this project should hand out. What
generalises — and what's here — is the record-keeping and the reply
classification.

## v0.12 — Agent Truth Layer + Evidence Lab

The public AgentRunner now separates verified work from process completion
instead of equating a successful model call with successful work.

- ✅ **Evidence-backed receipts.** The runner reads the persisted artifact back
  from disk, checks its exact byte count and SHA-256 digest, and records a
  versioned receipt without storing the private response body.
- ✅ **Fail-closed completion.** Empty/refusal-like output, or an artifact that
  is missing or mismatched during post-write read-back, cannot be marked
  successful in the run ledger.
- ✅ **Deterministic verdicts.** Each receipt becomes `healthy`,
  `verified_no_work`, `degraded_contradictory`, `failed`, or `stale`, with
  stable reason codes.
- ✅ **Automatic aging.** A once-healthy run becomes stale after its declared
  freshness deadline, including in summary and history reads.
- ✅ **Member isolation.** Receipt IDs are deterministic per durable run while
  the Truth receipt/SQLite identity uses only an install-keyed HMAC pseudonym;
  status reads are scoped to that member and run. The operational MySQL ledger
  remains member-email scoped.
- ✅ **Operator-visible status.** Agent and chat dashboards display compact
  Truth badges and reason-code tooltips beside the runner state.
- ✅ **Credential-free Evidence Lab.** One click writes and verifies a real
  local artifact with the production read-back primitive, appends exactly one
  byte, then re-verifies it as contradictory. It needs no model, account,
  credential, Docker runtime, or external network call.
- ✅ **Judge-ready verification.** `python scripts/test_all.py` runs every
  repository check in isolation, including the hermetic Truth Layer suite.

## v0.13 — Mission Control + verified Action Gate

v0.13 turns the standalone Truth dashboard into the first Mission Control
surface for a verified AgentOS. It deliberately prioritizes an inspectable,
fail-closed control path over a large but unverifiable integration count.

- ✅ **Source-backed capability registry.** A versioned, packaged JSON registry
  describes 71 capabilities with source paths, setup requirements, risk,
  approval, and read-back metadata: 4 built-in agents, 20 LLM-facing tools,
  33 implemented/setup-required provider adapters, and
  connector/channel/model-route entries. The provider adapter split is 9
  lead-source, 8 verification, 6 sender, and 10 CRM adapters.
- ✅ **Honest availability states.** `native`,
  `implemented/setup_required`, `bridge/catalog`, and `planned` are distinct.
  An implemented adapter is not presented as connected or configured.
- ✅ **Fail-closed Action Gate.** A caller supplies only a persisted receipt ID,
  stable action ID, and policy. The gate reads the current persisted verdict
  itself, reevaluates freshness through the service, binds the decision to that
  receipt/action/policy, atomically rechecks any allow against the latest
  verdict and freshness deadline, and writes an immutable audit record before
  returning. Missing, malformed, unavailable, failed, contradictory, stale, or
  concurrently expired evidence all block.
- ✅ **Two explicit policies.** `healthy_only` permits only a healthy receipt.
  `trusted_completion` permits healthy or verified no-work. A failed audit
  write cannot authorize an action.
- ✅ **Credential-free business-outcome proof.** A generated workflow writes
  three de-identified follow-up rows to a separate local SQLite destination,
  reopens and hashes the destination through an independent connection, and
  produces a healthy 3 → 3 receipt. The gate authorizes one bounded local
  outbox insert only after the exact audit decision is read back. After exactly
  one destination row is removed, the second
  read-back produces a contradictory 3 → 2 receipt; the gate blocks and the
  second callback is not invoked.
- ✅ **No hidden services in the judge path.** The outcome challenge uses no
  LLM, MySQL, API key, provider account, Docker runtime, or external call.
  The original one-byte Evidence Lab remains available.
- 📄 See [`globus_truth/README.md`](globus_truth/README.md) and
  [`docs/TRUTH_LAYER_BUILD_STORY.md`](docs/TRUTH_LAYER_BUILD_STORY.md).

## v0.14 — Consequence Firewall + Approval Center

v0.14 puts enforceable limits between an agent's plan and a consequential
effect. Its scope is intentionally concrete: four shipped background agents
and a local, inspectable approval coordinator.

- ✅ **Exact deny-by-default tool grants.** Research, Sales Desk, Narada, and
  Infra Watch each declare a non-empty runtime allowlist. The model sees only
  the granted tool schemas, and the orchestrator rechecks the tool name before
  dispatcher invocation. Forged disallowed calls cannot reach the tool
  implementation.
- ✅ **Delegation grant check.** A background agent can invoke only the tools
  assigned to it, and member chat can delegate only to agents granted by the
  organization gate. Missing grants fail closed.
- ✅ **Host-bound member sessions.** v2 session tokens sign the normalized
  arrival host, so an organization-portal cookie cannot be replayed against the
  single-tenant surface or another portal. Legacy unbound cookies require a
  fresh sign-in.
- ✅ **Registry/runtime drift guard.** The four agent-to-tool relations in the
  source-backed platform graph are tested against the enforced catalog
  allowlists. This does not imply that every one of the 71 inventory entries is
  governed, configured, connected, or live.
- ✅ **Payload-free Approval Center.** Exact proposals and immutable human
  decisions store identifiers, policy metadata, timestamps, proposal/payload
  hashes, and execution state—not raw action payloads.
- ✅ **Consent remains subordinate to Truth.** Approval cannot override a
  failed, contradictory, stale, or policy-ineligible receipt. Immediately
  before execution, the center obtains and reads back a fresh Action Gate
  decision, atomically rechecks Truth, and creates a unique execution claim.
- ✅ **Local at-most-once claim.** Only the creator of the unique claim invokes
  the bounded callback, so changed payloads and replays do not execute. This is
  not an external exactly-once guarantee; provider actions still require
  provider idempotency keys, acknowledgement read-back, and reconciliation.
- ✅ **Credential-free changed/exact/replay proof.** The dashboard and CLI
  stage a generated high-risk local action with zero executions before review.
  Approval demonstrates a changed payload blocked, the exact payload executed
  once after fresh Truth, and an exact replay blocked; independent read-back
  ends with one local outbox row. Rejection executes nothing.
- ✅ **Generic API and CLI.** Operators can create, inspect, approve, and reject
  exact proposals. The generic HTTP API deliberately does not accept or
  dispatch arbitrary callbacks; only the bounded built-in judge workflow
  performs its generated local callback.
- 📄 See [`globus_truth/README.md`](globus_truth/README.md) and
  [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## v0.15 — Verified Action SDK + execution timeline

v0.15 makes destination verification a required stage for SDK-managed
consequential actions. It extends the local Approval Center path without
claiming that external provider integrations are connected or exactly-once.

- ✅ **Strict action manifests.** Adapters declare one exact, versioned
  contract covering action kind, risk, Truth policy, explicit approval,
  deny-by-default permissions, deterministic idempotency, and independent
  read-back. Unknown fields and values fail closed.
- ✅ **Manifest-bound request digest.** The canonical SHA-256 envelope includes
  adapter ID, adapter version, action kind, and exact strict-JSON payload, so a
  payload cannot be silently moved between adapter contracts.
- ✅ **Deterministic idempotency.** A stable key binds proposal, adapter
  identity/version, action kind, and request digest. The Approval Center's
  unique claim remains the local authorization boundary.
- ✅ **Independent destination verification.** After execution, the adapter
  opens a new query-only destination connection and checks the observed
  effect. An immutable verification record binds proposal, claim, request,
  idempotency-key digest, observation digest, result, reason, and time.
- ✅ **Verification-gated completion.** SDK action completions require a bound
  destination-verification record whose verified/failed result agrees with the
  completion outcome. A claimed effect without proof stays indeterminate and
  is not automatically retried.
- ✅ **Six-stage derived timeline.** Mission Control derives proposal → human
  decision → Truth gate → execution claim → destination verification →
  completion from one SQLite snapshot. It does not duplicate those records
  into a mutable event log, and legacy completions are not relabeled verified.
- ✅ **Two safe reference adapters.** Email Draft and CRM Note model
  provider-shaped operations using generated rows in generated local SQLite
  sandboxes. Both perform independent read-back and expose privacy-safe hashes
  and counts.
- ✅ **Honest judge boundary.** The references connect no provider account,
  use no credential or outbound network, send no email, and update no external
  CRM. They are a local conformance path, not production deployment or an
  external exactly-once claim. v0.15 has not been deployed to the production
  Globus server.
- 📄 See [`globus_truth/README.md`](globus_truth/README.md) and
  [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md).

### 30/60/90-day path toward a verified AgentOS

This is a direction, not a claim of OpenClaw parity.

**Next 30 days — extend the control plane safely**

- [ ] Extend typed, deny-by-default grants beyond the four built-in background
  agents without presenting inventory-only capabilities as governed.
- [x] ✅ Add per-member installation state and health checks, while keeping
  “implemented” separate from “connected.” **Shipped in v0.18** —
  `server/member_state.py`, `GET /api/globus/member-state`, and
  `scripts/member_state_report.py`.
- [ ] Apply the Consequence Firewall to one reversible real-provider workflow
  with provider idempotency keys, destination acknowledgement/read-back,
  reconciliation, and audit export.
- [x] ✅ Add proper versioned migrations for both MySQL and Truth SQLite state.
  **Both shipped in v0.17** — `scripts/migrate.py` + `schema/migrations/` for
  MySQL, and `PRAGMA user_version` + in-code steps for the embedded Truth store.

**Next 60 days — add a narrow, safe extension SDK**

- [ ] Define a signed plugin manifest and isolated tool/connector protocol with
  declared permissions, secret requirements, risk, approval mode, and
  read-back contract.
- [ ] Add durable workflow state: queued runs, retries, leases, cancellation,
  resumability, and operator-visible checkpoints.
- [ ] Add policy scopes at organization, member, agent, tool, destination, and
  data-source levels, and extend the local Approval Center into an
  authenticated multi-member inbox.
- [ ] Ship a small set of well-tested first-party channel/connectors through the
  same contract rather than claiming every catalog entry is live.

**Next 90 days — grow an evidence-first ecosystem**

- [ ] Publish a compatibility kit and conformance tests for third-party
  adapters, including simulated provider failures and mandatory action
  read-back.
- [ ] Add signed registry distribution, provenance, revocation, sandboxing, and
  install-time permission review.
- [ ] Add multi-agent delegation with explicit capability grants, bounded
  budgets, traceable hand-offs, and Truth receipts at each consequential step.
- [ ] Add encrypted secret management, audit export, retention controls, and
  deployment hardening before describing the platform as production-ready.

## v0.16 — Shared inboxes: desk agents

Everything before this treats mail as the OPERATOR's own. v0.16 covers the other
shape: shared inboxes ("desks") owned by members of staff, each needing the same
automation, none of them belonging to the person who installed Globus.

Four agents, all opt-in per desk, all draft-first:

- ✅ **Spam rescue** — classifies the desk's Spam folder and moves genuine
  business mail back to the Inbox. The only agent here that mutates a mailbox,
  and the mutation is recoverable (the message can move back).
- ✅ **Responder** — someone wrote in and is waiting; classifies the request and
  drafts a reply grounded ONLY in the operator's playbook. With no playbook
  configured the composer is told it has no facts and must ask rather than
  answer — an invented price in a draft is worse than no draft, because a human
  skimming their Drafts sends it and the business is then committed to it.
- ✅ **Follow-up** — the inverse: we spoke last, they went quiet, a nudge is due.
  A cheap relevance gate decides whether a thread deserves one at all, and it
  fails CLOSED.
- ✅ **Learning** — reads what the human actually DID with the above (the edits
  they made before sending, the rescues they reversed) and writes a lesson each
  agent reads back on its next run, as markdown the desk owner can hand-edit.

The learning agent works BECAUSE the others draft. A human editing a draft
before sending is the richest correction signal available — free, unprompted,
and it shows the operator's real voice and policy rather than their stated one.
An agent that sent directly would be both riskier and unable to learn: the
safety property and the feedback channel are the same mechanism.

Four invariants worth reading the code for, each of which cost something:

- ✅ **A draft is never deleted once a human has sent it.** Sending one of our
  drafts from the Gmail web UI leaves the draft id resolvable and re-pointed at
  the SENT message, and `DELETE /drafts/<id>` is permanent — no Trash, no Sent,
  no copy anywhere. `delete_draft_if_unsent()` re-reads the object first and
  fails closed. The API send path does NOT reproduce the bug, so a positive
  control driven through `drafts.send` clears the code; only a UI send exposes
  it. An id you stored is a claim about the past, not a fact about the present.
- ✅ **Ask for stale threads; do not fetch the newest and filter.** Taking the
  most recent N sent threads and then keeping those past the staleness bar works
  on a quiet desk and silently yields nothing on a busy one, forever, with no
  error to notice. Querying `older_than:` makes a busier desk produce MORE
  candidates rather than fewer.
- ✅ **Only a send that POSTDATES a draft can be a human's edit of it.** Without
  that bound a multi-turn thread diffs today's draft against an older outbound
  turn and distils a confident, wrong lesson — which then feeds back into the
  composer's prompt on every future run.
- ✅ **Judge intent from THEIR messages only.** A gate that reads the whole
  thread, including a nudge this agent already sent, re-justifies its own first
  mistake on every subsequent run until it is permanent.

Also: per-(desk, agent) grants that start OFF, per-(agent, desk) heartbeats so
one healthy desk cannot mask a dead one, a bounded lesson store (it is read back
into a prompt, so an unbounded one is an unbounded prompt), and 48 behavioural
tests. See `server/email_desks.py`, `server/desk_agents.py` and
`scripts/desk_agents_run.py`.

✅ **Both v0.16 leftovers closed in v0.17:**

- **Grants are now set from the admin console**, not only the CLI —
  `org_desk_grants_html` renders an On/Off matrix inside `/members/globus/admin`.
  Each toggle submits the DESIRED END STATE rather than "flip it", so a
  double-submit or two admins acting at once cannot switch an agent on by
  accident. The write path validates the mailbox against the CONFIGURED desks
  rather than trusting the form: without that, an admin could post any address
  and start the agents reading — and for the rescue agent, moving — a mailbox
  nobody made a desk. The rendered page only ever offers real desks, but a page
  is not an authorization boundary.
- **`desk_agents_run.py digest`** rolls activity up into one heartbeat-gated
  notification, leading with the drafts still waiting on a human, oldest first
  (the one that has sat longest belongs to the customer who has waited longest).
  It refuses to emit an all-clear when nothing is reporting — writing this
  turned up a real bug in the first draft, which printed a green "no drafts
  waiting" tick directly beneath the red "NOT REPORTING" warning.

## v0.18 (current) — Per-member installation state

"Is it actually working for this person?" is the question an operator asks
repeatedly, and it has four different answers hiding inside it. Collapsing them
into a boolean is how support time gets burned:

  **IMPLEMENTED** the code ships it · **AVAILABLE** this install has it
  configured · **CONNECTED** the member wired their own account to it ·
  **WORKING** data has arrived and been processed

A capability can be implemented-and-unavailable (the operator never set up
Google OAuth), available-and-unconnected, connected-and-broken (the refresh
token was revoked on Tuesday), or connected-and-simply-empty. Those need
different actions, and **most of them are not the member's fault**.

- ✅ **`server/member_state.py`** — seven stages, never a bare boolean:
  `ready · ingesting · connected · not_connected · unavailable · error ·
  unknown`, across Drive, Gmail, the three bridges, the vault, the digest and
  agents.
- ✅ **`unavailable` is the distinction that does the most work.** Reporting
  "hasn't connected Drive" on an install with no Google client configured blames
  a member for the operator's omission and sends them to a button that cannot
  work. `install_capabilities()` reads that line from CONFIG, not from the
  member's rows, and `blockers()` attributes every gap to **operator** or
  **member** so a roster is actionable rather than just long.
- ✅ **A zero is never manufactured from a failed read.** `db_read` returns
  `None` on failure and empty on success, and the idiomatic `or []` merges them
  — so with the database down, every member would be confidently reported as
  brand new with nothing connected. That is the one output a health surface must
  never produce. `_rows()` raises; `partial=True` degrades to `unknown`, which
  renders as "could not check" and never as a zero.
- ✅ **Connected ≠ working.** A revoked connection is `error` even though it once
  synced 99 files. A vault 40% built stays `ingesting`, because it answers
  confidently from the part it has — which is exactly when a member concludes
  the assistant does not know things it in fact holds. A digest row under 200
  chars is `error`, that being the shape of a model's fluent refusal persisted
  as a member's brain.
- ✅ **`GET /api/globus/member-state`**, deliberately NOT folded into
  `/api/health?deep=1`, which is unauthenticated for load-balancer probes. This
  names members and their connected accounts: signed out is 401, a member sees
  only their own, and asking for anyone else 404s rather than 403s — the
  existence of a roster is not something a regular member needs to learn. An
  unreadable database is 503, never a cheerful empty answer.
- ✅ **`scripts/member_state_report.py`** for operators, exiting 1 when
  something is waiting on THEM. 43 tests (29 logic + 14 end-to-end over a real
  socket).

## v0.17 — Versioned schema migrations

Until now the schema was one big `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` bootstrap, and
nothing recorded what any given database had actually received. That fails
quietly rather than loudly: code deployed against a column nobody added does not
break at startup, it breaks on the one path that touches it — and because the
app's DB helper is fail-soft by design (`db_write` returns `False` on any
error), a write against a missing table returns `False` into a caller that does
not check, so the feature does nothing forever while every log line says it ran.

- ✅ **`schema/migrations/NNNN_name.sql`** — numbered, checksummed steps.
  `globus_schema.sql` stays the bootstrap for a FRESH install; migrations record
  what changed after it.
- ✅ **`schema_migrations` ledger** — version, name, SHA-256, applied_at.
- ✅ **`scripts/migrate.py status | up [--dry-run] | baseline`.** `baseline`
  exists because an install that predates migrations already HAS the tables:
  without it, the first real migration cannot tell "this database is ahead" from
  "this database is empty", and those need opposite handling.
- ✅ **It fails loudly**, using a raw connection rather than `db_write`.
- ✅ **It refuses rather than guesses.** A file not named `NNNN_name.sql` is
  refused, never skipped — a silently ignored migration looks exactly like an
  applied one. A migration numbered BELOW the highest already applied is refused
  too: that is two branches numbered independently and merged, and applying it
  now runs the steps in an order no environment has tested.
- ✅ **Honest about MySQL.** DDL implicitly commits, so a file failing on its
  third statement leaves the first two applied and nothing can roll that back.
  The runner stops at that file, does not record it, and names the exact
  statement — rather than implying an atomicity MySQL does not offer.
- ✅ **Drift detection.** A migration edited after it was applied shows as
  `CHANGED`, because your database has the old shape and so does everyone
  else's.
- ✅ 29 behavioural tests, including a statement splitter that does not cut on a
  semicolon inside a string, a backtick identifier, or a comment.

- ✅ **The Truth Layer's SQLite state is versioned too**, by a deliberately
  DIFFERENT mechanism, because it is a different kind of store: it is EMBEDDED
  — created and owned by the library, not administered by an operator — so its
  steps live in code that ships with it rather than in files someone has to
  remember to run, and its version lives in `PRAGMA user_version` inside the
  database file, where it cannot drift away from the data it describes. It also
  gets a guarantee MySQL cannot offer: **SQLite DDL is transactional**, so each
  step is atomic and a failure leaves the version untouched.
  Step 1 replaces an ad-hoc `PRAGMA table_info` patch that ran inline on every
  single connect and recorded nothing — which is exactly why it is written to
  tolerate finding its own result. 7 new tests (Truth suite 164 → 171).

v0.17 also closes the two things v0.16 shipped without — the desk-grant admin UI
and the desk digest (see the v0.16 section above for both).

## v1.0 — production-ready

Shipped:

- ✅ **Docker compose** (v1.0a) — `docker compose up` boots the Globus UI
  and MySQL in one command; LLM-backed chat/agents require a configured
  provider credential. Single-stage
  `python:3.12-slim` image, non-root user, named volumes for state,
  healthchecks, entrypoint handles wait-for-db + idempotent schema
  apply + SESSION_SECRET bootstrap + optional first-member seed.
- ✅ **`send_telegram_via_bot` LLM tool** (v1.0b) — closes the last
  gap in the tool dispatch chain. Member adds a TG bot via SQL
  (Fernet-encrypted token + allow-list of permitted chat_ids); LLM
  can post on member's behalf with default-deny on the allow-list +
  full audit in `globus_telegram_bot_sends`. `_V03_TOOLS` not-registered
  set is now empty (was previously holding 3 tools).

Still ahead:

- ✅ **Operator quality-of-life** (v1.0d) — `scripts/add_member.py`
  (CLI member creation, no SQL needed), `scripts/check_install.py`
  (pre-flight validator with colour OK/WARN/FAIL output), and a
  deep-mode `GET /api/health?deep=1` JSON endpoint with per-subsystem
  ok/error status (DB / storage / Fernet / persona / LLM provider).
  The shallow `/api/health` stays cheap for load balancer probes.
- [x] ✅ **Migration framework** (v0.17) — `schema/migrations/NNNN_name.sql`,
  a `schema_migrations` ledger, and `scripts/migrate.py status|up|baseline`,
  replacing the "re-run the .sql, it's idempotent" pattern. MySQL only; the
  Truth SQLite state is still unversioned (see the 30/60 item above).
- [ ] **Plugin architecture** — pip-installable extensions for
  custom data sources + custom tools (see ADR-007 in the
  buildwithsumit reference docs).
- [ ] **Voice cost rebuild** — ElevenLabs is fine for v0.4 but rough on
  margin at scale. Migrate to Cartesia (TTS) + Deepgram (STT) +
  optional LiveKit (transport).
- ✅ **First-class public preview** (v1.0e) — opt-in anonymous demo
  chat at the bottom of `/globus`. Enabled by setting
  `GLOBUS_PUBLIC_CHAT_ENABLED=1` in config or env. Strict guardrails:
  no vault access, no tools, no member data; per-IP sliding window
  (5/hour) + per-IP DB-backed daily cap (25/day) + install-wide
  daily cap (`GLOBUS_PUBLIC_CHAT_MAX_DAILY`, default 500); 500-char
  input, 600-token output; X-Forwarded-For aware for reverse-proxy
  installs; every request audited in `globus_public_chat_log`
  (ip + status + char counts, no message body — PII-conscious).
- ✅ **Telegram bot setup UI** (v1.0c) — `/members/telegram/bot` lets
  the member paste a BotFather token + comma-separated allow-list of
  chat_ids. Server validates the token by calling Telegram's `getMe`
  before saving (so typos / revoked tokens get caught up-front), then
  Fernet-encrypts and inserts. Page also lists existing bots and
  recent send attempts from the audit log.
