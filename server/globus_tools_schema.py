"""Globus LLM tool schemas — extracted from lead_server.py 2026-06-28
as refactor slice #6u. Pure data: OpenAI-style tool definitions
(DeepSeek is OpenAI-API-compatible) that the chat + voice loops
hand to the LLM so it can call into the per-member toolset
(search_files, read_file, search_content, search_telegram, etc.).

The Python implementations of these tools (globus_read_file,
globus_search_files, ...) still live in lead_server for now —
they have heavy cross-deps on the DB layer, the OAuth refresh chain,
and the Drive/Gmail download helpers. This module is just the
schema list the LLM sees.

No runtime code. No deps. ~290 lines of static dicts.
